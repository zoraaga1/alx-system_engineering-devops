# Incident Postmortem: 508 Loop Detected (WebDAV)

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** 1 hour, from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM (UTC-5)
- **Impact:** The WebDAV service experienced a 508 Loop Detected error, causing a subset of users to be unable to access or upload files through WebDAV. Approximately 20% of users were affected.

## Root Cause:
The issue was caused by a misconfigured WebDAV client that was repeatedly sending requests in a loop, triggering the 508 error.

## Timeline:
- **1:55 PM:** Issue detected by monitoring system showing increased error rates for WebDAV requests.
- **2:00 PM:** Engineer investigated and identified the 508 Loop Detected error in the WebDAV logs.
- **2:05 PM:** Checked WebDAV client configurations and found one client sending repeated requests due to a misconfiguration.
- **2:15 PM:** Attempted to stop the misbehaving client's requests manually, but the issue persisted.
- **2:30 PM:** Temporarily disabled the misconfigured client's access to the WebDAV service.
- **2:45 PM:** Verified that the error rate decreased and other clients were able to access the service normally.
- **3:00 PM:** Notified the client's owner of the misconfiguration and requested they update their settings.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** The 508 Loop Detected error was caused by a misconfigured WebDAV client that continuously sent requests in a loop.
- **Resolution:** The misconfigured client's access to the WebDAV service was temporarily disabled, stopping the loop and restoring service for other users.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:** Implement stricter client request limits and monitoring to detect and mitigate loops caused by misconfigured clients.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Update WebDAV client configuration guidelines and provide training for users to avoid misconfigurations.
  - Enhance monitoring to detect and automatically block clients causing excessive request loops.

## Lessons Learned:
- Regularly review and update client configurations to prevent misconfigurations that can lead to service disruptions.
- Implement automated monitoring and mitigation strategies to quickly identify and address abnormal client behavior.
